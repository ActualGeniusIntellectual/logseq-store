- **I love books**
- **Introduction**
	- I have an unabiding and romantic love of (non-fiction) books.
	- Besides being an avid reader as can be evinced from my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/173043304-actual-intellectual), I also believe that a daily regiment of reading contributes to a more well rounded intelligence.
	- There is a lot of ancestral knowledge locked up in books that sadly most of humanity will never avail itself to.
- **Praxis**
	- My goal is to read as many books as I can.
	- Most of my reading burden is felt in history. I love history.
	- My goal is to build a mental model of everything present in the world and I will do that by reading as many books I can before I die.
	- When I was younger, I dreamed about reading books in your sleep or fast-forwarding books into your brain somehow.
- Books Proper
	- Here is a bunch of different typologies, categories, books, series, etc. about books I enjoy.
